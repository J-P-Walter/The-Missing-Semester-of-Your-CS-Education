Taking this set of notes on vim
rebind escape to another key, saw another tutorial and make it jj
i is insert, x is backspace
currently not sold on this tbh
A while in normal mode to go to end of line and be in insert mode, a to append insert to right of cursor
0 goes to beginning, $ goes to end, ^ goes to non-empty character
ctrl u is pageup, ctrl d is pagedown, s is delete and insert 
really wish I could use 'i' to go up but worried that will throw off the rest of the keybinds
f character is find, ex fo finds first o, capital F jumps backwards
    t is similar, jumps to just before 
o creates new line in insert mode at same depth, O new line above
w to select word, e to move to end of word, b is same but backwards, ge to jump back to end
d is for deletion
    dw deletes word, u undo, de delete end of word 
    c is similar, cw for change, puts in input mode, ce to delete till end of word test
y is copy, yw is select word, p to paste
v to enter visual mode, select chunk of text, v again to exit
counts, can give command to do thing number of times, ex 4j goes up 4 times
i inside, ex ci[ or di( 
% to jump ()[],
/ starts search, n is next found, . repeats last
