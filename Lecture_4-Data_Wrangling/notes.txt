less is "pager", takes long amounts of content and condenses to size that 
    fits in terminal window
sed - stream editor, allows you to make changes to content of a stream
    usually run replacement on calls of a stream
        ex. sed 's/.*Disconnected from //' removed everything before Disconnected...
            .* regex
            's/[ab]//g', g flag repeats for all found
            * is 0 or more, . is any character
            run sed with -E to run more modern regex
            ^ achors to beginning, $ anchors end
            ? first found
regex - capture groups:
    remember vaue and use later, use ()
    \n, indexed at 1,
look for regular expression debugger, ex. regex101.com
wc is wordcount, -l is num lines
sort sorts
    sort -n numberic sort, -k to select column, ex 1,1 start and stop on first column
uniq pulls out unique, -c counts num of duplicates
awk is column based stream processor
    use $n, indexed at 1 to select specific columns
    can use regex with it too
