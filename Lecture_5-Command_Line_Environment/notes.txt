signals
    SIGINT differs from SIGQUIT
        ctrl+c vs ctrl+\
    SIGSTOP ctrl+z
        think of it like a pause
    jobs prints suspended and running jobs
    use %n to select jobs, indexed at 1
    use fg or bg to continue paused jobs
tmux
    new shell?
    separate from shell process
    ctrl+d to detach
    tmux a to reattach
    keybinding is prefix then ctrl B, then other keypress
        ex detatch is ctrl+b, then d
    tmux ls prints tmux sessions
    ctrl+b c creates new window
    ctrl+b p goes to previous window, n goes to next window, can also use numbers
    ctrl+b , renames
    ctrl+b w shows windows
    ctrl+b " splits
    ctrl+b arrow_key jumps between split windows
    ctrl+b z zooms, toggles current pane fullscreen
alias
    command that is built into shell, remaps longer sequence of characters into other sequence of characters
    alias x="args -flags"
    idea might be alias gs="git status"
    or to fix typos, alias claer="clear"
    can also auto put flags alias, mv="mv -i"
    normally goes away when shell is closed, can modify dotfile
        .bashrc, needs to be in home folder
